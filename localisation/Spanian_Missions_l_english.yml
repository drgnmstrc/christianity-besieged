He told the general that he had rushed to meet the army in hopes of brokering a deal with us. According to his story, the Lusitanian-appointed Duke of [GAL.GetName] had fled when he heard of our armies approaching, leaving the Bishop as the authority in the area. He said that if we allow him to reach the city before us, he can order the men of [GAL.GetName] to open their gates to us, and can even rally many of the other northern Iberians behind him."

As a response to our pogrom, renowned Jewish pirate Moses Cohen and his brother Abraham (the very same Rabbi that approached us on this matter in the first place) have organized a mass exodus of the Jews in our lands."
 fep_iberian_flavor.7.a: "Where do they possibly think they will go?"
 moroccan_jews_fleeing_tt: "The §YMaroka'im§! and §YSephardim§! in our lands will flee from our oppressive rule and sail to the West as far as their ships will take them..."
